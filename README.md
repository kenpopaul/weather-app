# Weather App

This is a simple React-based Weather App that provides current weather information for different locations.  It uses an api from https://openweathermap.org/ to fetch the relevant data.

## Getting Started

How to Run the App
------------------
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

First, you'll need to download a copy of the project to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command:
https://github.com/kenpopaul/weather-app.git
This will create a local copy of the project on your computer.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Use the cd command to change your current directory to the project folder:

Copy code
cd weather-app
This command tells the terminal to change the current directory to the weather-app folder.

Install Dependencies:
Before running the app, you need to install the necessary libraries and packages. Use the following command:
npm install
This command will automatically download and install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Get an API Key:
To fetch weather data, you'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in src/types.ts with your own API key.

Start the App:
Finally, to run the app, use the following command:
npm start
This will start a local development server and automatically open the app in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Now you should be able to use the Weather App to get current weather information for different locations!
